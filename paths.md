## Path of the Dewdrop Lotus

### Description

The Path of the Dewdrop Lotus uses primarily dream madra and secondarily force madra at about a 2:1 ratio.
Sacred Artists on this path traditionally fill specialized roles during wartime efforts focused on reconnaisance, infiltration, exfiltration, and field support.
Almost every Dewdrop Lotus sacred artist receives the Nightmare iron body, tailored to withstand the extreme stress and forces their techniques put on the mind.
The unique dream/force madra on this path is referred to as "psychic" madra, and is perfectly suited to enhance an artist's mental state or distrupt and destroy an opponent's.
The force aspect of the madra naturally penetrates madra channels and guides the dream aspect in a more offensive manner than most dream path techniques.
While not soley designed for one-to-one combat scenarious, most sacred artists are more conditioned to guard themselves against physical injury.
Combat against dream artists are fairly rare, and most dream styles focus on either creating illusions - such as the extinct White Fox path.
One mistep against madra specifically designed to break the shackles of one's sanity can leave an artist wishing they'd fought a more traditional opponent.

### Techniques

As with most paths, the foundation is split into 4 techniques.

The basic enforcer technique of the Dewdrop Lotus is called "stimulous wake" or just "wake."
Firstly, force madra is used to greatly increase the acceleration and deceleration capacity of the artist's limbs.
This makes the artist able to move and strike more quickly and more powerfully without too much excess strain.
The real power of the technique, however, is produced by forcing highly concentrated dream madra through the channels in the brain, the spine and the peripheral nervous.
Without the strength of the Nightmare iron body, this technique would be fatal, but the extraordinary resiliance of the iron mind, the sacred artist's mental capacity can be expanded beyond normal mortal means.
Visual and aural processing, reaction speed, analytical potential; nearly all nervous system processing is amplified, resulting in one of the most versatile enforcer techniques in all of the sacred arts.

The basic striker technique of the Dewdrop Lotus, the "concussive shell" or just the "shell", is a slow moving but powerful shock wave of psychic that directly damages the mind and the nervous system of the target.
This technique is generally used in combination with others on the path to distract or disable the opponent in order to create an opening for attack.
The natrual attributes of the path's "psychic" madra cause this attack to devastate the mind and nervous pathways while leaving the flesh undisturbed.

The basic ruler technique of the Dewdrop Lotus, causes affected sacred artists in a certain radius to experience debilitating levels of anxiety, pain and fear.
This "hell shroud" is very difficult to control and often affects allies and enemies alike.
Because most Dewdrop Lotus artists work alone or in small squads of others on the same path, their iron minds significantly reduce the self-inflicted effects of this technique.

The basic forger technique of the Dewdrop Lotus is the "haunter."
Barely perceptable explosive balls of force madra are cloaked in dream madra and natrually track those experiencing negative emotions.
The name "haunter" comes from the apt tradition of artists forging these bombs into the shapes of ghosts and ghouls.
The bombs are triggered by low-levels of force madra accompanying varying levels of physical contact determined by the forger.
The results of the trigger are fairly self-explanatory, as one can easily imagine the effects of a sudden release of compacted force madra.
The nature of their psychic madra can also cause these bombs to have similar effects on opponents as the hell shroud technique, but this is generally just a welcome side-effect.

The irony of the contrast between the Dewdrop Lotus's wild and uncontrolled techniques and their penchant as saboteurs and spies has been noted by several a scholar.
Aside from the wake technique, rarely do these artists use their psychic madra during missions or to attack enemies directly.
They are useful mostly as mechanisms of escape, but can be quite useful in large-scale conflicts.

## The Nightmare Iron Body

The Nightmare iron body is realized through the ritualized completion of a hellish trial within the confines of one's own mind.
The trial, induced via a traditional - and quite expensive - elixir, forces the sacred artist to confront terrifying manifestations of their subconscious.
The ritual creates extremely high levels of mental and physical stress which routinely destroys the minds of weaker artists.
When successful, artists on this path are said to have not only an iron body, but an iron mind.
The iron mind is extremely resiliant to stress, pain, fear and fatique.
It requires less than one hour's sleep per day to function at max capacity.
In fact, those with the Nightmare iron body, often sleep more to keep their bodies fresh than for the need to dream.
For the iron mind can slip seemlessly into waking dreams, without any significant diminishing of situational awareness.
In this state the mind can perceive that which is beyond most others.
Legends tell of an Underlord on the path of the Dewdrop Lotus that could read the minds of any artist at a lower level of advancement.
