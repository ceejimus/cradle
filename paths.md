## Path of the Lotus

### Description

The Path of the Lotus uses primarily dream madra and secondarily force madra at about a 2:1 ratio.
Sacred Artists on this path traditionally fill specialized roles during wartime efforts focused on reconnaissance, infiltration, exfiltration, and field support.
Almost every Lotus sacred artist receives the Nightmare iron body, tailored to withstand the extreme stress and forces their techniques put on the mind.
The unique dream/force madra on this path is referred to as "psychic" madra, and is perfectly suited to enhance an artist's mental state or damage an opponent's.
The force aspect of the madra naturally penetrates madra channels and guides the dream aspect in a more controlled manner than dream madra techniques from other paths.
While the path is not combat oriented, talented Lotus artists can be quite potent combatants.
Most sacred artists condition themselves more against physical attacks and attacks to their madra systems.
Combat against dream artists are fairly rare, and most dream styles focus on creating and manipulating illusions - such as the extinct White Fox path.
One misstep against madra specifically designed to break the shackles of one's sanity can leave an artist wishing they'd fought a more traditional opponent.

### Techniques

As with most paths, the foundation is split into 4 techniques.

The basic enforcer technique of the Lotus is called "stimulus wake" or just "wake."
Firstly, force madra is used to greatly increase the acceleration and deceleration capacity of the artist's limbs.
This makes the artist able to move and strike more quickly and more powerfully without too much excess strain.
The real power of the technique, however, is produced by forcing highly concentrated dream madra through the channels in the brain, the spine and the peripheral nerves.
Without the strength of the Nightmare iron body, this technique would be fatal, but with the extraordinary resilience of the iron mind, the sacred artist's mental capacity can be expanded beyond normal mortal means.
Visual and aural processing, reaction speed, analytical potential; nearly all nervous system processing is amplified, resulting in one of the most versatile enforcer techniques in all of the sacred arts.

The basic striker technique of the Lotus, the "concussive shell" or just "shell", is a slow moving but powerful shock wave of psychic madra that directly damages the mind and the nervous system of the target.
This technique is generally used to disrupt enemy attack formations or in combination with other Lotus techniques that distract or disable opponents in order to create an opening for attack.
The natural attributes of the path's "psychic" madra cause this attack to devastate the mind and nervous pathways while leaving the body relatively undisturbed.

The basic ruler technique of the Lotus, causes affected sacred artists in a certain radius to experience debilitating levels of anxiety, pain and fear.
This "hell shroud" is very difficult to control and often affects allies and enemies alike.
Because most Lotus artists work alone or in small squads of others on the same path, their iron minds significantly curb the self-inflicted effects of this technique.

The basic forger technique of the Lotus is the "haunter."
Barely perceptible explosive balls of force madra are cloaked in dream madra and naturally track those experiencing negative emotions.
The name "haunter" comes from the apt tradition of artists forging these bombs in the shapes of ghosts and ghouls.
The bombs are triggered by low-levels of force madra accompanying varying levels of physical contact determined by the forger.
The results of the trigger are fairly self-explanatory, as one can easily imagine the effects of a sudden release of compacted raw force.
The nature of their psychic madra can also cause these bombs to have similar effects on opponents as the hell shroud technique, but this is generally just a welcome side-effect.

The irony of the contrast between the Lotus's wild and uncontrolled techniques and their penchant as saboteurs and spies has been noted by several a scholar.
Aside from the wake technique, rarely do these artists use their psychic techniques to attack enemies directly.
They are useful mostly as mechanisms of escape, but can be quite useful in large-scale conflicts.

## The Nightmare Iron Body

The Nightmare Iron Body is preferred, if not required, for the path of the Lotus.
The Nightmare body is manifested by the ritualized completion of a hellish trial within the confines of one's own mind.
During their sleep, the advancing sacred artist confronts terrifying manifestations of their subconscious.
While less physically advantageous than most other advanced iron bodies, wielders of the Nightmare body are said to have not just an iron body, but an iron mind.
Artists with this iron mind are extremely resistant to stress, pain, fear and fatigue.
They requires far less sleep to function, and proficient wielders are able to sleep while still aware of their surroundings.
Of particular note are claims made of the body's advantages at post-gold levels of advancement.
There are legends of an Underlord Lotus elder who was so sensitive to dream madra that she could read minds.
Also of note, is the fact that this is the only recorded advancement process of sacred artists advancing in their sleep.
